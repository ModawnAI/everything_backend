## Fixes Applied (2025-10-16)

### 1. Shops List Test ✅
- **Problem**: Looking for table selectors on a card-based layout
- **Solution**: Updated selectors to check for "샵 목록" heading and card elements
- **Result**: Test now passes in 9.6s

### 2. User Management Tests ✅
- **Problem**: Networkidle timeout + wrong selectors (expected tables, page uses cards)
- **Solution**:
  - Changed from `networkidle` to `domcontentloaded` + timeout
  - Updated selectors to match actual page structure (cards)
- **Result**: All 3 tests now pass (7.9s, 6.7s, 5.6s)

### 3. API Smoke Test Korean Title ✅
- **Problem**: Title regex didn't account for Korean characters
- **Solution**: Updated regex to accept both English and Korean: `/login|sign in|ebeautything|에뷰리띵|어드민/i`
- **Result**: Test now passes in 893ms
