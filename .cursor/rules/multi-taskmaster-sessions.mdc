# Multi-TaskMaster Session Management

## **Context Switching Between Phases**
- **Always check current tag** before executing task-master commands
- **Switch to appropriate tag** based on work context:
  - `phase-5-payment-points`: Payment system, security, deployment pipeline work
  - `phase-6-social-feed`: Social feed, content management, feed algorithm work

## **Tag Switching Protocol**
- **Before any task-master command**: Check current tag with `task-master list` or verify tag in output
- **Switch tags when needed**:
  ```bash
  # Switch to payment system work
  task-master use-tag phase-5-payment-points
  
  # Switch to social feed work  
  task-master use-tag phase-6-social-feed
  ```

## **Session Management Best Practices**
- **Identify work context** from user requests:
  - Payment, security, deployment, testing → `phase-5-payment-points`
  - Social feed, content, algorithms, moderation → `phase-6-social-feed`
- **Always verify tag** before marking tasks complete or updating status
- **Switch proactively** when context changes in conversation
- **Confirm tag switch** by checking task list after switching

## **Command Execution Pattern**
```bash
# 1. Check current context
task-master list

# 2. Switch if needed
task-master use-tag <appropriate-phase>

# 3. Execute intended command
task-master <command>
```

## **Context Indicators**
- **Phase 5 Keywords**: payment, security, deployment, pipeline, health checks, monitoring, TossPayments, webhook, fraud detection
- **Phase 6 Keywords**: social feed, posts, content, moderation, algorithms, hashtags, likes, comments, feed ranking

## **Error Prevention**
- **"Parent task X not found" error** → Wrong tag, switch to correct phase
- **Empty task list** → Verify correct tag is active
- **Task ID mismatch** → Check if task exists in current tag context

## **Temporary Rule Status**
- **Duration**: Until multi-session work is complete
- **Removal**: Remove this rule when working on single phase or single session
- **Purpose**: Prevent task management errors across multiple concurrent sessions
