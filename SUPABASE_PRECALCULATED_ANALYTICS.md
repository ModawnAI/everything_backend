# Supabase Pre-Calculated Analytics (Database-Level Solution)

## Overview

Instead of calculating analytics in Node.js, **let PostgreSQL/Supabase do the heavy lifting** using:

1. **Materialized Views** - Pre-calculated query results stored as tables
2. **Scheduled Refresh** - Auto-refresh views every 5 minutes using `pg_cron`
3. **Database Functions** - Complex calculations done in SQL
4. **API Reads Pre-Calculated Data** - Instant response (< 10ms)

**Benefits:**
- âœ… **10-100x faster** - No calculation during API requests
- âœ… **Instant responses** - Just SELECT from materialized view (< 10ms)
- âœ… **Less Node.js memory** - No caching needed in application
- âœ… **Automatic refresh** - Database handles scheduling
- âœ… **Scales better** - Database optimized for aggregations

## Solution 1: Materialized Views (Recommended) ðŸš€

### Step 1: Create Materialized Views

Run these SQL migrations in Supabase:

```sql
-- ============================================================================
-- MATERIALIZED VIEW: Dashboard Quick Metrics
-- Refreshes every 5 minutes via pg_cron
-- ============================================================================

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dashboard_quick_metrics AS
WITH
  -- User metrics
  user_metrics AS (
    SELECT
      COUNT(*) as total_users,
      COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE user_status = 'active') as active_users,
      COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)) as new_users_this_month,
      COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month')
                        AND created_at < DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)) as new_users_last_month
    FROM users
  ),

  -- Revenue metrics
  revenue_metrics AS (
    SELECT
      COALESCE(SUM(amount) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'fully_paid'), 0) as total_revenue,

      COALESCE(SUM(amount) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'fully_paid'
                        AND created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)), 0) as month_revenue,
      COALESCE(SUM(amount) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'fully_paid'
                        AND created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month')
                        AND created_at < DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)), 0) as last_month_revenue

-- Create index for fast access
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_dashboard_quick_metrics_single_row ON dashboard_quick_metrics ((1));

-- ============================================================================
-- MATERIALIZED VIEW: Daily Revenue Trends (Last 30 days)
-- ============================================================================

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_revenue_trends AS
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COALESCE(SUM(amount) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'fully_paid'), 0) as revenue,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'fully_paid') as transactions
FROM payments
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

CREATE INDEX idx_daily_revenue_trends_date ON daily_revenue_trends(date);

-- ============================================================================
-- MATERIALIZED VIEW: Daily Reservation Trends (Last 30 days)
-- ============================================================================

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_reservation_trends AS

  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed,
  COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0) as revenue

GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

CREATE INDEX idx_daily_reservation_trends_date ON daily_reservation_trends(date);

-- ============================================================================
-- MATERIALIZED VIEW: Shop Performance Metrics
-- ============================================================================

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW shop_performance_metrics AS
SELECT
  s.id as shop_id,
  s.name as shop_name,
  s.main_category as category,
  COUNT(r.id) as reservation_count,
  COUNT(r.id) FILTER (WHERE r.status = 'completed') as completed_count,
  CASE
    WHEN COUNT(r.id) > 0
    THEN ROUND((COUNT(r.id) FILTER (WHERE r.status = 'completed')::numeric / COUNT(r.id)) * 100, 2)
    ELSE 0
  END as completion_rate,
  COALESCE(SUM(p.amount) FILTER (WHERE p.payment_status = 'fully_paid'), 0) as total_revenue,
  s.shop_status as status,
  s.verification_status,
  NOW() as last_updated
FROM shops s
LEFT JOIN reservations r ON r.shop_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN payments p ON p.reservation_id = r.id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name, s.main_category, s.shop_status, s.verification_status
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

CREATE INDEX idx_shop_performance_shop_id ON shop_performance_metrics(shop_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_shop_performance_revenue ON shop_performance_metrics(total_revenue DESC);

-- ============================================================================
-- MATERIALIZED VIEW: Revenue by Category
-- ============================================================================

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW revenue_by_category AS

LEFT JOIN payments p ON p.reservation_id = r.id
GROUP BY s.main_category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

CREATE INDEX idx_revenue_by_category_category ON revenue_by_category(category);
```

### Step 2: Set Up Auto-Refresh with pg_cron

Enable and configure pg_cron in Supabase:

```sql
-- Enable pg_cron extension (run once)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;

-- Schedule refresh every 5 minutes for all materialized views
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-dashboard-quick-metrics',
  '*/5 * * * *',  -- Every 5 minutes
  $$REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY dashboard_quick_metrics;$$
);

SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-daily-revenue-trends',
  '*/5 * * * *',
  $$REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY daily_revenue_trends;$$
);

SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-daily-reservation-trends',
  '*/5 * * * *',
  $$REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY daily_reservation_trends;$$
);

SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-shop-performance-metrics',
  '*/5 * * * *',
  $$REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY shop_performance_metrics;$$
);

SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-revenue-by-category',
  '*/5 * * * *',
  $$REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY revenue_by_category;$$
);

-- Check scheduled jobs
SELECT * FROM cron.job;

-- View job run history
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 3: Update Node.js Service to Read Pre-Calculated Data

**File**: `src/services/admin-analytics.service.ts`

Replace complex calculations with simple SELECT queries:

```typescript
/**
 * Get quick dashboard metrics from pre-calculated materialized view
 * Response time: < 10ms (just a SELECT query!)
 */
async getQuickDashboardMetrics(adminId: string): Promise<QuickDashboardMetrics> {
  try {
    logger.info('Getting quick dashboard metrics from materialized view', { adminId });

    // Single SELECT query to get pre-calculated metrics
    const { data, error } = await this.supabase
      .from('dashboard_quick_metrics')
      .select('*')
      .single();

    if (error) throw error;

    if (!data) {
      throw new Error('No metrics data available');
    }

    // Just map the database fields to response format
    return {
      totalUsers: data.total_users,
      activeUsers: data.active_users,
      newUsersThisMonth: data.new_users_this_month,
      userGrowthRate: data.user_growth_rate,

      totalRevenue: data.total_revenue,
      todayRevenue: data.today_revenue,
      monthRevenue: data.month_revenue,
      revenueGrowthRate: data.revenue_growth_rate,

      totalReservations: data.total_reservations,
      activeReservations: data.active_reservations,
      todayReservations: data.today_reservations,
      reservationSuccessRate: data.reservation_success_rate,

      totalShops: data.total_shops,
      activeShops: data.active_shops,
      pendingApprovals: data.pending_approvals,

      totalTransactions: data.total_transactions,
      successfulTransactions: data.successful_transactions,
      conversionRate: data.conversion_rate,

      lastUpdated: data.last_updated
    };

  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error getting quick dashboard metrics', {
      adminId,
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error'
    });
    throw error;
  }
}

/**
 * Get revenue trends from pre-calculated materialized view
 * Response time: < 50ms
 */
async getRevenueTrends(period: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' = 'daily', limit: number = 30) {
  const { data, error } = await this.supabase
    .from('daily_revenue_trends')
    .select('*')
    .order('date', { ascending: false })
    .limit(limit);

  if (error) throw error;

  return data;
}

/**
 * Get shop performance metrics from pre-calculated materialized view
 * Response time: < 100ms
 */
async getShopPerformanceMetrics(limit: number = 10) {
  const { data, error } = await this.supabase
    .from('shop_performance_metrics')
    .select('*')
    .order('total_revenue', { ascending: false })
    .limit(limit);

  if (error) throw error;

  return data;
}

/**
 * Get revenue by category from pre-calculated materialized view
 * Response time: < 20ms
 */
async getRevenueByCategory() {
  const { data, error } = await this.supabase
    .from('revenue_by_category')
    .select('*')
    .order('total_revenue', { ascending: false });

  if (error) throw error;

  return data;
}
```

### Step 4: Create Migration File

**File**: `supabase/migrations/20250107_create_analytics_materialized_views.sql`

```sql
-- Create all materialized views and cron jobs
-- (Copy all SQL from Step 1 and Step 2)

-- Note: This migration should be run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- with appropriate permissions for pg_cron
```

---

## Solution 2: Database Functions (Alternative)

If materialized views aren't suitable, use PostgreSQL functions:

```sql
-- Create function to calculate quick metrics
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_quick_dashboard_metrics()
RETURNS TABLE (
  total_users BIGINT,
  active_users BIGINT,
  new_users_this_month BIGINT,
  user_growth_rate NUMERIC,
  total_revenue NUMERIC,
  today_revenue NUMERIC,
  month_revenue NUMERIC,
  revenue_growth_rate NUMERIC,
  total_reservations BIGINT,
  active_reservations BIGINT,
  today_reservations BIGINT,
  reservation_success_rate NUMERIC,
  total_shops BIGINT,
  active_shops BIGINT,
  pending_approvals BIGINT,
  total_transactions BIGINT,
  successful_transactions BIGINT,
  conversion_rate NUMERIC,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP
) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  WITH
    user_metrics AS (
      SELECT
        COUNT(*)::BIGINT as total_users,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE user_status = 'active')::BIGINT as active_users,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE))::BIGINT as new_users_this_month,
        COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 month')
                          AND created_at < DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE))::BIGINT as new_users_last_month
      FROM users
    ),
    -- ... (rest of the metrics CTEs from materialized view)

  SELECT
    um.total_users,
    um.active_users,
    um.new_users_this_month,
    CASE
      WHEN um.new_users_last_month > 0
      THEN ROUND(((um.new_users_this_month - um.new_users_last_month)::numeric / um.new_users_last_month) * 100, 2)
      ELSE 0
    END,
    -- ... (rest of the calculations)
    NOW()
  FROM user_metrics um, revenue_metrics rm, reservation_metrics rsm, shop_metrics sm, payment_metrics pm;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE;

-- Call from Node.js
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('get_quick_dashboard_metrics');
```

## Performance Comparison

| Approach | Response Time | Database Load | Memory Usage |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Current (Node.js calculation)** | 5-10 seconds | High (many queries) | High (caching) |
| **Quick endpoint (Node.js)** | < 500ms | Medium (parallel queries) | Medium |
| **Materialized Views** | **< 10ms** | **None** (pre-calculated) | **None** |
| **Database Functions** | < 100ms | Low (single query) | None |

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Create Materialized Views (1 day)
1. Run SQL migrations to create materialized views
2. Set up pg_cron for auto-refresh
3. Test queries directly in Supabase SQL Editor

### Phase 2: Update Node.js Service (2 hours)
1. Replace complex calculations with simple SELECT queries
2. Remove caching logic (no longer needed!)
3. Update response mappings

### Phase 3: Test & Monitor (1 day)
1. Test endpoint performance (should be < 10ms)
2. Monitor materialized view refresh jobs
3. Check data freshness
4. Load testing with production-like data

### Phase 4: Add More Views (ongoing)
1. Create views for detailed sections (user growth, revenue trends, etc.)
2. Add more granular materialized views as needed

---

## Monitoring Materialized Views

### Check View Freshness
```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  matviewname,
  pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname || '.' || matviewname)) as size,
  last_refresh
FROM pg_matviews
WHERE matviewname LIKE 'dashboard%' OR matviewname LIKE 'daily%'
ORDER BY matviewname;
```

### Check Cron Job Status
```sql
-- View all scheduled jobs
SELECT * FROM cron.job ORDER BY jobname;

-- View recent job runs
SELECT
  job_id,
  status,
  start_time,
  end_time,
  (end_time - start_time) as duration
FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE job_id IN (SELECT jobid FROM cron.job WHERE jobname LIKE 'refresh-%')
ORDER BY start_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Manual Refresh (if needed)
```sql
-- Refresh all dashboard views
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY dashboard_quick_metrics;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY daily_revenue_trends;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY daily_reservation_trends;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY shop_performance_metrics;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY revenue_by_category;
```

---

## Frontend Integration

The frontend code doesn't change - the endpoint remains the same, just **100x faster**:

```typescript
// Same API call, but now returns in < 10ms instead of 5-10 seconds
const metrics = await api.get('/api/admin/analytics/dashboard/quick');
setDashboard(metrics);
setLoading(false); // Instant!
```

---

## Advantages of Database-Level Pre-Calculation

### âœ… Performance
- **< 10ms response time** - Just a SELECT query
- **No application caching** - Database handles it
- **Scales automatically** - PostgreSQL is optimized for this

### âœ… Reliability
- **Always fresh data** - Refreshes every 5 minutes automatically
- **No cache invalidation issues** - Database handles consistency
- **Survives server restarts** - Not in-memory

### âœ… Maintainability
- **SQL is easier to maintain** - Complex calculations in one place
- **Can debug in SQL Editor** - Test queries directly in Supabase
- **Reusable** - Other services can read the same views

### âœ… Cost-Effective
- **Less compute on Node.js** - Offload to database
- **Less memory usage** - No caching needed in application
- **Better resource utilization** - Database does what it's best at

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Use CONCURRENTLY for Refreshes
```sql
-- Good: Non-blocking refresh
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY dashboard_quick_metrics;

-- Bad: Blocks reads during refresh
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW dashboard_quick_metrics;
```

### 2. Create Unique Index for CONCURRENTLY
```sql
-- Required for CONCURRENTLY refresh
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_dashboard_quick_metrics_single_row
  ON dashboard_quick_metrics ((1));
```

### 3. Monitor Refresh Duration
```sql
-- Check how long refreshes take
SELECT
  jobname,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time))) as avg_duration_seconds,
  MAX(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time))) as max_duration_seconds
FROM cron.job j
JOIN cron.job_run_details jrd ON j.jobid = jrd.job_id
WHERE jobname LIKE 'refresh-%'
GROUP BY jobname;
```

### 4. Keep Views Simple
- Don't over-aggregate - create multiple simpler views
- Avoid expensive JOINs across many tables
- Use WHERE clauses to filter data early

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Materialized view not refreshing
```sql
-- Check if pg_cron extension is enabled
SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_cron';

-- Check cron jobs
SELECT * FROM cron.job;

-- Check for errors
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY start_time DESC;
```

### Issue: Slow refresh times
```sql
-- Check view size
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('dashboard_quick_metrics'));

-- Add indexes to base tables
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_status_created
  ON payments(payment_status, created_at);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reservations_status_created
  ON reservations(status, created_at);
```
