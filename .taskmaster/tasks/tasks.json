Only mock configuration fixes needed before full validation.\n</info added on 2025-09-18T06:03:27.650Z>",

The validation schema issue is now clear:\n\n**VALIDATION SCHEMA CORRECTION REQUIRED:**\n\n1. **Import Error Fix**: The user-settings.express-validator.ts file incorrectly imports 'validateRequest' from './validation.middleware' but should use 'handleValidationErrors' from express-validator's validationResult pattern as shown in user-profile.express-validator.ts:15-44.\n\n2. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The validation schemas contain extra fields not present in the actual user_settings database table. Database table only includes:\n   - push_notifications_enabled\n   - reservation_notifications  \n   - event_notifications\n   - marketing_notifications\n   - location_tracking_enabled\n   - language_preference\n   - currency_preference\n   - theme_preference\n\n3. **Extra Fields to Remove**: Both Joi and express-validator schemas include non-existent database fields:\n   - timezone\n   - date_format\n   - time_format\n   - email_notifications\n   - sms_notifications\n   - sound_enabled\n   - vibration_enabled\n\n**Required Actions**:\n1.

Remove validation rules for non-existent database fields from both user-settings.validators.ts and user-settings.express-validator.ts\n3.

Here is the completion update:\n\nCOMPLETED: Enhanced Bulk Operations with Transaction Safety has been successfully implemented with comprehensive enterprise-grade features. Key implementation achievements include:\n\n**Enhanced Data Structures**: Extended UserBulkActionRequest interface with targetRole, useTransaction (default true), and configurable batchSize parameters. Added UserBulkActionResult interface with detailed tracking including previousValue, newValue, and timestamp fields. Enhanced UserBulkActionResponse with progress tracking, transactionId, rollbackAvailable flag, and executionTime metrics.\n\n**Transaction Safety Architecture**: Implemented processBatchWithTransaction method using rollback data collection since Supabase doesn't support traditional client-side transactions. Added rollbackBatchOperations method that reverses operations in case of batch failures. Created transaction ID system for audit trails and debugging. Implemented batch-level atomicity where any failure within a batch triggers automatic rollback of all previous operations in that batch.\n\n**Progress Tracking System**: Added configurable batch processing with default 50 users per batch through batchSize parameter. Implemented comprehensive progress tracking including currentBatch, totalBatches, completedItems, and remainingItems. Added execution time tracking for performance monitoring and optimization. Detailed logging for each batch processing step with transaction ID correlation.\n\n**Enhanced Error Handling**: Individual user validation with detailed error reporting per operation. Comprehensive error collection and reporting per user with timestamp tracking. Graceful handling of partial failures with detailed result breakdown showing success/failure status for each user. Separate processing paths for transaction-enabled and transaction-disabled modes.\n\n**Bulk Role Assignment**: Added 'change_role' action to bulk operations with targetRole parameter validation. Implemented privilege escalation prevention specifically for admin role assignments. Integrated seamlessly with existing updateUserRole method for consistency. Added role-specific validation and security checks to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.\n\n**Controller Integration**: Extended validation logic for new bulk action parameters in admin-user-management.controller.ts. Added privilege escalation prevention specifically for bulk role assignments. Implemented batch size validation with reasonable limits (1-100 users per batch). Enhanced request parameter extraction and validation with proper type checking.\n\n**Real-time WebSocket Integration**: Added comprehensive WebSocket broadcasting for bulk operations with detailed metadata including transaction ID, success/failure counts, and operation details. Integrated with existing admin activity monitoring system for real-time dashboard updates. Broadcast includes operation context for enhanced admin visibility.\n\n**Rollback Mechanisms**: Implemented comprehensive rollback system that automatically triggers on any batch failure. Automatic restoration of previous user status/role values on transaction failure. Detailed rollback logging for audit trails and debugging purposes. Clear rollback availability indication in API responses for administrative transparency.\n\nThe enhanced bulk operations system now provides enterprise-grade reliability with transaction safety, comprehensive progress tracking, detailed error handling, and robust rollback mechanisms for all administrative bulk actions while maintaining backward compatibility with existing implementations.\n</info added on 2025-09-19T05:46:57.920Z>",

Updated spatial utility functions to use secure query builder, replacing raw SQL construction with parameterized queries while maintaining PostGIS spatial functionality. Integrated all middleware into app.ts at lines 92-98 with proper positioning after security headers. The implementation provides real-time detection and blocking of SQL injection attempts, comprehensive input sanitization across all request vectors (query parameters, body, headers), IP blocking for repeat offenders with configurable thresholds, detailed security logging and violation statistics, and graceful error handling to prevent service disruption.\n</info added on 2025-09-19T03:31:19.914Z>",

Implemented rate limiting for CSRF token generation and comprehensive violation tracking with IP-based blocking after 3 violations. Added domain-specific validation and improved security configuration with longer tokens and enhanced algorithms.\n\nUpdated security headers configuration (security.config.ts:1-50) with enhanced Content Security Policy directives including script-src-attr and style-src-attr for better XSS protection, improved frame-ancestors and object-src settings, and production-specific security hardening.\n\nCreated comprehensive admin security management system (admin-security-enhanced.routes.ts:1-100+) providing real-time security statistics dashboard, individual service monitoring for XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and RPC security, security history reset capabilities, and health status monitoring with service-level indicators accessible only to authenticated administrators.\n\nSuccessfully integrated both XSS and CSRF protection middleware into the main application middleware stack (app.ts) positioned after SQL injection prevention for layered security defense.
