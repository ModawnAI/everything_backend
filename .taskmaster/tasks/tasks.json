The validation schema issue is now clear:\n\n**VALIDATION SCHEMA CORRECTION REQUIRED:**\n\n1. **Import Error Fix**: The user-settings.express-validator.ts file incorrectly imports 'validateRequest' from './validation.middleware' but should use 'handleValidationErrors' from express-validator's validationResult pattern as shown in user-profile.express-validator.ts:15-44.\n\n2. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The validation schemas contain extra fields not present in the actual user_settings database table. Database table only includes:\n   - push_notifications_enabled\n   - reservation_notifications  \n   - event_notifications\n   - marketing_notifications\n   - location_tracking_enabled\n   - language_preference\n   - currency_preference\n   - theme_preference\n\n3. **Extra Fields to Remove**: Both Joi and express-validator schemas include non-existent database fields:\n   - timezone\n   - date_format\n   - time_format\n   - email_notifications\n   - sms_notifications\n   - sound_enabled\n   - vibration_enabled\n\n**Required Actions**:\n1.

Here is the completion update:\n\nCOMPLETED: Enhanced Bulk Operations with Transaction Safety has been successfully implemented with comprehensive enterprise-grade features. Key implementation achievements include:\n\n**Enhanced Data Structures**: Extended UserBulkActionRequest interface with targetRole, useTransaction (default true), and configurable batchSize parameters. Added UserBulkActionResult interface with detailed tracking including previousValue, newValue, and timestamp fields. Enhanced UserBulkActionResponse with progress tracking, transactionId, rollbackAvailable flag, and executionTime metrics.\n\n**Transaction Safety Architecture**: Implemented processBatchWithTransaction method using rollback data collection since Supabase doesn't support traditional client-side transactions. Added rollbackBatchOperations method that reverses operations in case of batch failures. Created transaction ID system for audit trails and debugging. Implemented batch-level atomicity where any failure within a batch triggers automatic rollback of all previous operations in that batch.\n\n**Progress Tracking System**: Added configurable batch processing with default 50 users per batch through batchSize parameter. Implemented comprehensive progress tracking including currentBatch, totalBatches, completedItems, and remainingItems. Added execution time tracking for performance monitoring and optimization. Detailed logging for each batch processing step with transaction ID correlation.\n\n**Enhanced Error Handling**: Individual user validation with detailed error reporting per operation. Comprehensive error collection and reporting per user with timestamp tracking. Graceful handling of partial failures with detailed result breakdown showing success/failure status for each user. Separate processing paths for transaction-enabled and transaction-disabled modes.\n\n**Bulk Role Assignment**: Added 'change_role' action to bulk operations with targetRole parameter validation. Implemented privilege escalation prevention specifically for admin role assignments. Integrated seamlessly with existing updateUserRole method for consistency. Added role-specific validation and security checks to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.\n\n**Controller Integration**: Extended validation logic for new bulk action parameters in admin-user-management.controller.ts. Added privilege escalation prevention specifically for bulk role assignments. Implemented batch size validation with reasonable limits (1-100 users per batch). Enhanced request parameter extraction and validation with proper type checking.\n\n**Real-time WebSocket Integration**: Added comprehensive WebSocket broadcasting for bulk operations with detailed metadata including transaction ID, success/failure counts, and operation details. Integrated with existing admin activity monitoring system for real-time dashboard updates. Broadcast includes operation context for enhanced admin visibility.\n\n**Rollback Mechanisms**: Implemented comprehensive rollback system that automatically triggers on any batch failure. Automatic restoration of previous user status/role values on transaction failure. Detailed rollback logging for audit trails and debugging purposes. Clear rollback availability indication in API responses for administrative transparency.\n\nThe enhanced bulk operations system now provides enterprise-grade reliability with transaction safety, comprehensive progress tracking, detailed error handling, and robust rollback mechanisms for all administrative bulk actions while maintaining backward compatibility with existing implementations.\n</info added on 2025-09-19T05:46:57.920Z>",

The project has comprehensive Jest configuration with specific Supabase mocking utilities, but the issues outlined suggest systematic problems with mock implementation.\n\nCritical fixes needed based on test failure analysis:\n\n1. **Supabase Mock Chain Issues**: The existing reservation-supabase-mock.ts at tests/utils/reservation-supabase-mock.ts has incomplete query chain handling. Methods like .single(), .order(), .select() need proper chaining that returns promises with consistent data structures matching actual Supabase client responses.\n\n2. **Service Method Alignment**: Tests are calling methods that don't match the actual ReservationService implementation in src/services/reservation.service.ts. The service uses method names like createReservation() but tests may expect different naming conventions.\n\n3. **Mock Data Structure**: Current mock data in reservation-supabase-mock.ts uses basic objects but tests expect specific database schema fields matching the reservation table structure (id, user_id, shop_id, reservation_date, status, etc.).\n\n4. **Timeout Configuration**: Jest timeout is set to 30000ms in jest.config.js and setup-comprehensive.ts, but complex database operations and retry mechanisms may need longer timeouts for comprehensive tests.\n\n5. **Test Setup Dependencies**: The test setup files (setup.ts, setup-comprehensive.ts, setup-env.ts) have overlapping configurations that could cause conflicts. The setup includes reservation-database-setup.ts which may fail if not properly mocked.\n\nSpecific implementation fixes required:\n\n- Update tests/utils/reservation-supabase-mock.ts to properly handle .single().then() chains and return correct data structures\n- Align test method calls with actual ReservationService class methods (createReservation, updateReservation, etc.)\n- Fix mock query builders to handle complex Supabase operations like .rpc() calls for database functions\n- Ensure mock responses match expected reservation data schema from src/types/database.types.ts\n- Implement proper error simulation for deadlock and connection timeout scenarios\n- Add timeout handling for tests that involve retry mechanisms and concurrent operations\n</info added on 2025-09-22T01:51:33.698Z>",
