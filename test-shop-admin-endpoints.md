# Shop and Admin Endpoint Testing Guide

## Overview

This document provides testing procedures for the shop-scoped and admin platform endpoints that implement dashboard separation architecture.

## Architecture Summary

### üîê Security Layers (Defense in Depth)

```
Layer 1: JWT Authentication (authenticateJWT)
         ‚Üì
Layer 2: Middleware Validation (validateShopAccess)
         ‚Üì
Layer 3: Controller Filtering (ALWAYS filter by shop_id)
         ‚Üì
Layer 4: Database Queries (shop_id in WHERE clause)
```

## Endpoint Structure

### Shop-Scoped Endpoints (Pattern: `/api/shops/:shopId/*`)
- **Purpose**: Shop owners/managers manage their own shop
- **Access Control**:
  - Platform admins (super_admin, admin) ‚Üí Can access any shop
  - Shop roles (shop_owner, shop_manager, shop_admin, manager) ‚Üí Only their own shop
- **Middleware Chain**: `authenticateJWT()` ‚Üí `validateShopAccess`

### Admin Platform Endpoints (Pattern: `/api/admin/*`)
- **Purpose**: Platform admins manage all shops
- **Access Control**: Only platform admins (super_admin, admin)
- **Middleware Chain**: `authenticateJWT()` ‚Üí `requireAdmin()`

## Testing Procedures

### Prerequisites

1. **Server Running**: `npm run dev`
2. **Database Seeded**: Ensure test data exists
3. **Authentication Tokens**:
   - Platform admin token (role: `admin` or `super_admin`)
   - Shop owner token (role: `shop_owner`, has `shop_id`)

### Test Scenarios

#### ‚úÖ Test 1: Shop Owner Accessing Own Shop Reservations
```bash
# Replace with actual shopId from database
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/shops/{shopId}/reservations?page=1&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {shop_owner_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: 200 OK with reservations for that shop
```

#### ‚ùå Test 2: Shop Owner Accessing Different Shop (Should Fail)
```bash
# Try to access a different shop's data
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/shops/{different_shopId}/reservations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {shop_owner_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: 403 Forbidden
# {
#   "success": false,
#   "error": {
#     "code": "SHOP_ACCESS_DENIED",
#     "message": "Access denied: You can only access your own shop"
#   }
# }
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 3: Platform Admin Accessing Any Shop
```bash
# Admin can access any shop
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/shops/{any_shopId}/reservations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: 200 OK with that shop's reservations
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 4: Platform Admin Getting All Reservations
```bash
# Admin sees ALL shops
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/reservations?page=1&limit=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {admin_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: 200 OK with reservations from ALL shops
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 5: Update Reservation Status (Shop Owner)
```bash
curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:3001/api/shops/{shopId}/reservations/{reservationId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {shop_owner_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "status": "confirmed",
    "notes": "Reservation confirmed by shop"
  }'

# Expected: 200 OK with updated reservation
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 6: Get Shop Payments with Filters
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/shops/{shopId}/payments?status=completed&page=1&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {shop_owner_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: 200 OK with payments, pagination, and summary
```

#### ‚úÖ Test 7: Get Payment Details
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/api/shops/{shopId}/payments/{paymentId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {shop_owner_token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Expected: 200 OK with detailed payment info including refund history
```

## Security Validation Checklist

### ‚úÖ Data Isolation
- [ ] Shop owners can ONLY see their own shop's data
- [ ] Attempting to access other shops returns 403 Forbidden
- [ ] Platform admins can access any shop
- [ ] All database queries include `shop_id` filter

### ‚úÖ Authentication
- [ ] All endpoints require valid JWT token
- [ ] Expired tokens return 401 Unauthorized
- [ ] Missing tokens return 401 Unauthorized

### ‚úÖ Authorization
- [ ] `validateShopAccess` middleware blocks cross-shop access
- [ ] `requireAdmin()` middleware blocks non-admin access to admin endpoints
- [ ] Role validation works correctly

### ‚úÖ Defense in Depth
- [ ] Middleware validates shop access
- [ ] Controllers double-check shop_id
- [ ] Database queries always filter by shop_id
- [ ] Audit logging captures access attempts

## Key Security Features

### 1. Shop Access Validation (`validateShopAccess`)
Located in: `src/middleware/shop-access.middleware.ts`

**Logic**:
```typescript
// Platform admins can access ANY shop
if (role === 'super_admin' || role === 'admin') {
  return next(); // Allow access
}

// Shop roles must match their shop_id
if (userShopId !== shopId) {
  return 403; // Deny access
}
```

**Features**:
- Validates shopId format (alphanumeric, UUID)
- Verifies shop exists in database
- Checks shop status (active/suspended)
- Logs all access attempts
- Security event tracking for unauthorized attempts

### 2. Always Filter by shop_id

**Every controller query includes**:
```typescript
// Shop-scoped endpoint
.eq('shop_id', shopId)  // ALWAYS present, defense in depth

// Admin endpoint (optional filter)
if (shopId) {
  query = query.eq('shop_id', shopId);
}
```

### 3. Audit Trail

All shop access is logged:
```typescript
logger.info('üìã [AUDIT] Shop access logged', {
  userId: user.id,
  shopId,
  action: `${req.method} ${req.path}`,
  ipAddress: req.ip,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

---

## Frontend Integration

The frontend should use a `ContextualApiService` that automatically transforms URLs:

```typescript
// Platform admin context
/api/reservations ‚Üí /api/admin/reservations

// Shop context (shopId = "shop-123")
/api/reservations ‚Üí /api/shops/shop-123/reservations
```

This ensures the frontend doesn't need to know about the routing structure and the backend enforces security at every layer.

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Verify Current Implementation**: Endpoints are implemented and follow the spec
2. üîÑ **Run Test Suite**: Execute the test scenarios above
3. üìä **Monitor Logs**: Check for security events and access patterns
4. üìù **Document for Frontend**: Share endpoint structure with frontend team
5. üîç **Performance Testing**: Test with large datasets and concurrent requests
