# Payment Security Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for the payment security testing suite, including penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and compliance validation for the payment system.

## Security Test Categories

### 1. Basic Security Tests (`test:security:basic`)
Quick security validation tests covering essential security measures:
- Webhook signature verification
- Basic input validation
- Authentication checks
- Rate limiting validation

**Duration**: ~5-10 minutes  
**Use Case**: Development workflow, CI/CD pipeline

```bash
npm run test:security:basic
```

### 2. Comprehensive Security Tests (`test:security:comprehensive`)
Full security test suite covering all security aspects:
- All basic security tests
- Advanced penetration testing
- Business logic security
- Performance security testing
- Compliance validation

**Duration**: ~15-30 minutes  
**Use Case**: Pre-deployment validation, weekly security checks

```bash
npm run test:security:comprehensive
```

### 3. Penetration Testing (`test:security:penetration`)
Advanced penetration testing scenarios based on OWASP Top 10:
- Broken Access Control (A01)
- Cryptographic Failures (A02)
- Injection Attacks (A03)
- Insecure Design (A04)
- Security Misconfiguration (A05)
- Race conditions and timing attacks
- Business logic bypass attempts

**Duration**: ~20-45 minutes  
**Use Case**: Security audits, vulnerability assessments

```bash
npm run test:security:penetration
```

### 4. Compliance Testing (`test:security:compliance`)
PCI DSS and GDPR compliance validation:
- Payment data encryption verification
- Audit trail validation
- Data retention policy enforcement
- Sensitive data handling

**Duration**: ~10-20 minutes  
**Use Case**: Compliance audits, regulatory requirements

```bash
npm run test:security:compliance
```

### 5. Performance Security Tests (`test:security:performance`)
Security testing under load conditions:
- Concurrent security operations
- DoS attack prevention
- Rate limiting under load
- Security service scalability

**Duration**: ~30-60 minutes  
**Use Case**: Load testing, performance validation

```bash
npm run test:security:performance
```

### 6. Vulnerability Assessment (`test:security:vulnerability`)
Automated vulnerability scanning:
- Known vulnerability patterns
- Security configuration issues
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Code security analysis

**Duration**: ~20-40 minutes  
**Use Case**: Security audits, vulnerability management

```bash
npm run test:security:vulnerability
```

## Security Test Coverage

### Webhook Security
- **HMAC-SHA256 signature verification**: Prevents webhook forgery
- **Timestamp validation**: Prevents replay attacks
- **IP whitelisting**: Restricts webhook sources
- **Idempotency checks**: Prevents duplicate processing
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents webhook flooding

### Payment Security
- **SQL injection prevention**: Input sanitization and parameterized queries
- **XSS prevention**: Output encoding and content security policies
- **Authentication bypass**: Proper session management and authorization
- **Amount manipulation**: Business logic validation
- **Race condition prevention**: Concurrent payment handling

### Fraud Detection
- **Velocity checking**: Unusual payment patterns
- **Geolocation validation**: Suspicious location detection
- **Device fingerprinting**: Bot and automation detection
- **Risk scoring**: Real-time fraud assessment
- **Security alerting**: Automated threat response

### Compliance
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data protection
- **GDPR**: Personal data privacy and protection
- **Audit trails**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Data retention**: Automated data lifecycle management

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Database Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Security Configuration (Optional)
TOSS_PAYMENTS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
TOSS_PAYMENTS_ALLOWED_IPS=ip1,ip2,ip3
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key
TEST_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Test Database Setup

1. **Use dedicated test database**: Never run security tests against production
2. **Configure test data**: Ensure proper test data isolation
3. **Enable security logging**: Monitor security events during testing
4. **Set appropriate timeouts**: Security tests may take longer than unit tests

## Security Test Reports

### Report Generation
Security tests automatically generate detailed reports in `test-reports/security/`:

```json
{
  "testSuite": "Comprehensive Security Tests",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "results": {
    "totalTests": 45,
    "passedTests": 43,
    "failedTests": 2,
    "duration": 1800000
  },
  "securityMetrics": {
    "vulnerabilitiesFound": 2,
    "securityTestsCovered": 45,
    "complianceScore": 95.6
  }
}
```

### Key Metrics
- **Vulnerability Count**: Number of security issues found
- **Compliance Score**: Percentage of compliance tests passed
- **Security Coverage**: Number of security scenarios tested
- **Performance Impact**: Security overhead measurement

## Security Test Integration

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Security Tests
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run security tests
        run: npm run test:security:comprehensive
        env:
          SUPABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_URL }}
          SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }}
```

### Pre-deployment Checklist

- [ ] Penetration tests show no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Compliance tests meet regulatory requirements
- [ ] Security performance tests show acceptable overhead
- [ ] Security reports reviewed and approved

## Common Security Issues and Solutions

### 1. Webhook Signature Failures
**Issue**: Webhook signature verification fails  
**Solution**: 
- Verify webhook secret configuration
- Check signature encoding (base64 vs hex)
- Ensure raw body is used for signature calculation

### 2. Rate Limiting Bypasses
**Issue**: Rate limiting can be bypassed  
**Solution**:
- Implement distributed rate limiting
- Use multiple rate limiting strategies (IP, user, endpoint)
- Monitor for rate limiting bypass attempts

### 3. Business Logic Vulnerabilities
**Issue**: Payment amount manipulation  
**Solution**:
- Implement server-side validation
- Use database constraints
- Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### 4. Authentication Weaknesses
**Issue**: Session management vulnerabilities  
**Solution**:
- Implement proper session timeout
- Use secure session storage
- Add multi-factor authentication

## Security Testing Best Practices

### 1. Test Environment Isolation
- Use dedicated test databases
- Isolate test networks
- Implement proper test data management

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage
- Test all security boundaries
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Validate both positive and negative scenarios

### 3. Regular Testing Schedule
- Daily: Basic security tests
- Weekly: Comprehensive security tests
- Monthly: Penetration testing
- Quarterly: Full vulnerability assessment

### 4. Security Monitoring
- Monitor security test results
- Track security metrics over time
- Alert on security test failures
- Review security reports regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Environment Variables Missing**
   ```bash
   ❌ Missing required environment variables:
      - SUPABASE_URL
      - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   ```
   **Solution**: Set required environment variables in `.env` file

2. **Database Connection Failures**
   ```bash
   ❌ Failed to connect to test database
   ```
   **Solution**: Verify database credentials and network connectivity

3. **Security Service Initialization Errors**
   ```bash
   ❌ Failed to initialize security services
   ```
   **Solution**: Check service dependencies and configuration

4. **Test Timeout Issues**
   ```bash
   ❌ Security tests timed out
   ```
   **Solution**: Increase test timeout or optimize test performance

### Debug Mode
Run security tests with verbose output for debugging:

```bash
npm run test:security:comprehensive -- --verbose
```
