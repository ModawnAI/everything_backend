- **Distance Calculation**: Accurate geographic distance
- **Geofencing**: Seoul city boundary validation
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response for nearby shops

### Shop Sorting Algorithm (PRD 2.1)
```sql
ORDER BY 
  CASE WHEN s.shop_type = 'partnered' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,  -- ÏûÖÏ†êÏÉµ Ïö∞ÏÑ†
  s.partnership_started_at DESC,                           -- ÏµúÏã† ÏûÖÏ†êÏàú
  distance ASC                                             -- Í±∞Î¶¨Ïàú
```

## üè™ Shop Registration Workflow

### Shop Owner Registration Process
1. **Basic Information**: Name, address, phone, email
2. **Business Verification**: License number, document upload
3. **Service Setup**: Categories, services, pricing
4. **Image Upload**: Shop photos, service images
5. **Contact Methods**: KakaoTalk channel, social media
6. **Admin Review**: Verification and approval process

### Approval Workflow
```
pending_approval ‚Üí (admin review) ‚Üí verified/rejected
verified ‚Üí active (shop goes live)
rejected ‚Üí inactive (with feedback)
```

## üìä Business Logic Requirements

### Shop Discovery Logic
- **Location Filtering**: Within specified radius (default 10km)
- **Category Filtering**: By service type (nail, eyelash, etc.)
- **Status Filtering**: Only active, verified shops
- **Availability Filtering**: Shops accepting reservations

### Shop Profile Management
- **Image Management**: Multiple images per shop with ordering
- **Service Catalog**: Flexible pricing (min/max), duration
- **Operating Hours**: JSON-based weekly schedule
- **Contact Integration**: Multiple contact methods support

### Admin Approval System

- **Manual Review**: Admin approval with notes
- **Automated Checks**: Basic information completeness
- **Notification System**: Status updates to shop owners

## üîê Security & Validation

### Input Validation
- **Business License**: Korean format validation with checksum
- **Address**: Korean address format validation
- **Phone Numbers**: Korean mobile/landline format
- **Image Uploads**: File type, size, and security validation

### Authorization Rules
- **Shop Owners**: Can only manage their own shops
- **Admins**: Can manage all shops with audit logging
- **Users**: Can view active shops and add to favorites

### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data**: Business documents stored securely
- **Privacy**: Contact information access controls
- **Audit Trail**: All admin actions logged

## üß™ Testing Requirements

CREATE INDEX idx_shops_category_location ON shops(main_category, location) 
WHERE shop_status = 'active';

-- Shop owner management
CREATE INDEX idx_shops_owner_status ON shops(owner_id, shop_status);
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

2. **Optimization**: Compression, resizing, format conversion
3. **Storage**: Supabase Storage with CDN
4. **Metadata**: Alt text, display order, categorization

### Contact Method Integration
```json
{
  "contact_methods": [
    {
      "type": "kakao",
      "label": "Ïπ¥Ïπ¥Ïò§ÌÜ° Ï±ÑÎÑê",
      "value": "https://pf.kakao.com/_abc123",
      "is_primary": true
    },
    {
