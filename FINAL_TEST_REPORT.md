---

## Critical Bugs Fixed (6 Total)

### 1. ✅ CRUD Operations Bug - **CRITICAL** (Fixed)
**Issue**: GET/PUT/DELETE operations returned 404 for valid service IDs after creation
**Root Cause**: Validator was stripping `shopId` parameter with `stripUnknown: true`
**Fix**: Added `shopId` to `serviceIdSchema` validation
**File**: `src/validators/shop-service.validators.ts:369-390`
**Result**: All CRUD operations now work correctly (100% success rate)

### 2. ✅ Dashboard Stats Endpoint Missing - **HIGH** (Fixed)
**Issue**: Frontend called `/api/admin/dashboard/stats` but only `/overview` existed
**Fix**: Added alias route `/stats` pointing to same controller method
**File**: `src/routes/dashboard.routes.ts:138`
**Result**: Dashboard stats accessible to frontend (HTTP 200)

### 3. ✅ Service Catalog Categories Mismatch - **HIGH** (Fixed)
**Issue**: Frontend called `/categories` but backend had `/metadata`
**Fix**: Added alias route `/categories` pointing to metadata controller
**File**: `src/routes/service-catalog.routes.ts:482`
**Result**: Service catalog categories now accessible (HTTP 200)

### 4. ✅ Shop Search Parameter Missing - **MEDIUM** (Fixed)
**Issue**: GET /shops ignored search query parameter
**Fix**: Added search parameter extraction and filtering with `ilike` for Korean/English support
**Files**: `src/controllers/admin-shop.controller.ts:60-70, 129-132`
**Result**: Shop search works with both languages (HTTP 200)

### 5. ✅ Shop Reservations Endpoint Missing - **MEDIUM** (Fixed)
**Issue**: GET /shops/:shopId/reservations didn't exist
**Fix**: Created endpoint with proper schema mapping (status, total_amount vs incorrect service_id, reservation_status)
**Files**: `src/routes/admin-shop.routes.ts:379-383`, `src/controllers/admin-shop.controller.ts:1268-1294`
**Result**: Returns 28 reservations with pagination and filtering (HTTP 200)

### 6. ✅ Shop Analytics SQL Error - **HIGH** (Fixed)
**Issue**: GET /api/admin/analytics/shops/:shopId/analytics failed with "column shops.rating does not exist"
**Root Cause**: Query referenced non-existent `rating` and `review_count` columns in shops table
**Fix**: Removed columns from SELECT query and calculated from reviews table instead
**Files**: `src/services/admin-analytics.service.ts:1724-1777`
**Result**: Analytics endpoint returns comprehensive shop data (HTTP 200)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### ⚠️ Minor Issues (2 endpoints)

1. **Analytics Health Endpoint Hangs**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/analytics/health`
   - **Status**: Hangs indefinitely, no response
   - **Impact**: Low - monitoring endpoint, not user-facing
   - **Investigation**: Needs debugging of async/await chain

2. **Analytics Refresh Endpoint Hangs**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/analytics/refresh`
   - **Status**: Hangs after 2 minutes
   - **Impact**: Low - cache refresh can be done via /cache/clear
   - **Investigation**: Needs timeout handling improvement

### ℹ️ Expected Behavior (3 endpoints)

1. **Shop Owner Reservation Management**
   - **Endpoints**: PUT /confirm, PUT /reject, PUT /complete
   - **Status**: Returns business logic errors (deposit required, state transition rules)
   - **Impact**: None - correct validation enforcement
   - **Note**: These are feature requirements, not bugs

2. **User Management Edge Cases**
   - **Issue**: Invalid UUID returns 404 instead of 400
   - **Impact**: Minimal - error handling preference
   - **Status**: Acceptable - 404 is semantically correct
